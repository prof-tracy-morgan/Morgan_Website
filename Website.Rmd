This website is a final project for ACC-8143 Accounting Data Analytics at Mississipi State.  

I am a graduate student at Mississippi State seeking a Master of Taxation degree with a minor in Data Analytics.  

To create this website, we used R.  R is a software program for data manipulation, data calculations, and data graphing.  R can be connected with GitHub to create a website!
