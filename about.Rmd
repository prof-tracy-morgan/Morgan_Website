Hi, I'm Tracy Morgan and I am an Accounting and Business teacher for Holmes Commuity College and an adjunct instructor for Mississippi College.  I live in Clinton, MS with my husband Mike.  

Mike is a professor of Finance at the University of Southern Mississippi.  We both love teaching and when we have a break, we like to spend time with family and go see our grandkids.  We have 3 kids, 3 bonus kids, and 3 grandkids!
